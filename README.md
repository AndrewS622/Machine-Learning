Andrew Ng's Machine Learning at Stanford University Course on Coursera

This course covers a theoretical introduction to machine learning concepts, including both supervised and unsupervised algorithms, as well as practical concepts for how to best implement different algorithms, monitor for convergence, and tune hyperparameters. Programming exercises included in this repo were completed in the Octave/MATLAB environment. The course covers the following topics, with a * denoting a topic which includes a programming exercise:

1. Introduction, Univariate Linear Regression, Gradient Descent, and Linear Algebra
2. Multivariate Linear Regression, The Normal Equation, The Octave Programming Environment*
3. Logistic Regression, One-vs-All Classification, Regularization*
4. Neural Network Structure and Forward Propagation*
5. Backpropagation, Random Initialization, and Gradient Checking*
6. Train/Validation/Test Sets, Bias vs. Variance, Learning Curves, Error Analysis, and Precision and Recall*
7. Support Vector Machines*
8. K-Means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis*
9. Anomaly Detection, Multivariate Gaussian Models, Recommender Systems, Collaborative Filtering, and Low Rank Matrix Factorization*
10. Stochastic Gradient Descent, Mini-batch Gradient Descent, Online Learning, and Map-Reduce
11. Photo Optical Character Recognition, ML Pipelines, and Ceiling Analysis
